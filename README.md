My solution for the Golden Gate Bridge problem can be found in the Golden Gate directory.
The solution is explained in detail in goldenGate.txt.
There are some supplementary images that I created in a lego simulator that are used to help visualize part of my solution.


---- PART 3 ----

The scrabble word script can be found in the BestWord directory of this repository.
The script is written in Ruby, and can be run by running "ruby bestWord.rb".
The program will prompt the user for input.  Follow the instructions to use the script.


---- PART 4 ----

The code for the website is in the Part_4_FrontEnd directory.
To start the server, run "node app.js" while in the ignCodeFooFrontend directory (within the Part_4_FrontEnd directory).
The website was written entirely in Javascript and HTML/CSS.  The Express.js, node.js, and AngularJS frameworks were also used.


---- BONUS ----

I have created an online version of Hearts, a classic card game played with a 52-card deck.
The code for the game is located in the "Hearts/IGN_Hearts" directory.
To start the server, run "node app.js" while in the IGN_hearts directory.
The website was written entirely in Javascript and HTML/CSS.  The Express.js, node.js, and AngularJS frameworks were also used.

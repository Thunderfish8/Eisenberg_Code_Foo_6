PART 3:
The scrabble word script can be found in the BestWord directory of this repository.
The script is written in Ruby, and can be run by running "ruby bestWord.rb".
The program will prompt the user for input.  Follow the instructions to use the script.

PART 4:
The code for the website is in the Part_4_FrontEnd directory.
To start the server, run "node app.js" while in the ignCodeFooFrontend directory (within the Part_4_FrontEnd directory).
The website was written entirely in Javascript and HTML/CSS.  The Express.js, node.js, and AngularJS frameworks were also used.
